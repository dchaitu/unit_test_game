# Ant vs Bees

A Flutter Web App project.

## Getting Started

This project contains 3 types of Ants in a tunnel each consuming a different quantity of food.
Each ant can attack at different ranges in the tunnel.

The game will be completed if either the ants destroy all the bees in the hive or the bees reach the starting point of the ant tunnel.
